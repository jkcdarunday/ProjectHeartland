SystemOne Lite
==============

What is this?
-------------

This is an experimental user interface design for SystemOne with the goal of creating a one-page enlistment web-app that communicates with an API that handles only the basic functionalities needed for enlistment.

It is also a goal of this design to work with caching 

The reason for this is so that the server hosting the website will not have to serve each webpage/image to each user while part of its processing power and network bandwidth is allocated to the transmission and processing of data. It will also reduce the amount of SYN packets being received by the server.

How do I test this?
-------------------

You will have clone this repository into a folder and copy the files to the root directory of a web server that runs PHP.
It is recommended to configure your PHP to not spout error messages.


Coding Convention
-----------------

  * Four spaces will be used for indentation in script files, HTML files, and CSS files.

  * Do not use tabs when indenting. There should be a configuration in your text editor that turns indentation into spaces and to disable adding \t's.

  * Optional code may be commented.
